        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 Tablespoons salted butter (don't use margarine></li>
            <li>16 oz bag mini marshmallows</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>6 cups rice krispies cereal</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a 9-inch square baking dish with parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Once melted, add in all but 1 cup of the marshmallows.
                 Reduce heat to low and continue stirring until completely melted.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. Add the cereal and the remaining 1 cup of marshmallows.</li>
            <li>Pour into the prepared baking dish. Press GENTLY with your fingertips just until completely
                 spread out (the harder you pack them in, the harder they are to eat).</li>
